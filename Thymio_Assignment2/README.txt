The tasks, files to launch the simulations and implementations are as follows:

TASK 1: 
SCRIPT NAME: assignment2_task1.py
XML NAME: compulsory.launch.xml
--- The robot follows a circular movement.

TASK2: 
SCRIPT NAME: assignment2_task3.py
XML NAME: compulsory.launch.task2_3
--- MyT moves straight ahead until it is close to the wall (without hitting it)
then turns in place in such a way as to face the wall as precisely as possible (the robot's x-axis is orthogonal to the wall)

TASK3:
SCRIPT NAME: assignment2_task3.py
XML NAME: compulsory.launch.task2_3
--- The robot then rotates indefinitely to face away from the wall. At this step, it gets stuck in an infinite rotating loop. We have implemented the code for the robot to move to a point that is 2 meters away from the wall. We have tested this function and it works, although it is not shown as the robot does not stop rotating.

BONUS1:
SCRIPT NAME: assignment2_task5.py
XML NAME: bonus.launch.xml
--- We have created a robot that randomly explores the environment, avoiding any obstacles. The video of the simulation can be found here:
